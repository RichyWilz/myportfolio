    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>
       I am a Ugandan junior full-stack developer with a wide range of knowledge in the 
       creation of applications, fluent in Django and flutter frameworks for creating 
       applications currently at campus. I am passionate about writing code for apps that
       are not only functional but also give the users satisfaction plus intuitive 
       knowledge on what they're working with. I believe in simplicity and using 
       generally approachable methods to deliver quality, satisfactory and genuine 
       work which also reflects in my lifestyle as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important for humanity to acknowledge that through consistent, simple and 
        do-able steps; the world can continue to become a better place, which is one of 
        the things that I also stand for, a better world. Which means it's essential for 
        me as a developer to create better quality work for a better world.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a developer, my passion is to see my work help out in companies and 
        organizations that continue to create products, job opportunities and also give a 
        sense of hope to humanity through giving back to the community. Surely it's such 
        passion that drives me to be better than the developer I was yesterday and to 
        continue sharpening my coding skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've had exposure to different front-end web development technologies such as 
        HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Python and Dart. Having started with building 
        pure html, css, and javascript projects before building actual application 
        projects, such as an online library application(used Django), and a restaurant 
        app(collaborative flutter app).  I also learnt how to work with the backend 
        technologies such as Postgres, Excel, Workbench and MySql when creating databases 
        which makes me an actual full-stack developer who can make applications with a 
        front and backend interacting effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to know that 80% of the technologies I know were self-taught with 
        HTML,CSS and JS having been entirely self- learnt....if such a thing exists.
    </p>

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some of the various projects I've worked on.
    </p>

    <div class="projectsbox">
        <div class="project">
        <h3>Library app.</h3>
        <p>
            This app enables a student to borrow a book in a library online before 
            picking it there in a given time frame which now becomes unavailable to 
            others, returning it within a given time frame and having to pay any fine 
            should there be one. It also enables the librarian to add books to the list 
            of available books in the app and also view all those who've borrowed books. 
            It basically automates the actual events of a real library in a way that makes
            it easy for students to reserve books for their usage, librarians to avail 
            books for students plus keep track of the borrowed books. A link to 
            the actual application will be posted soon.
            <!-- {username: Librarian, password:1234} -->
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Html documentation.</h3>
            <p>
                This is a mimic of the general lookout of the software and other 
                technology or general purpose documentations that are found on the
                internet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>JS Train Passenger Counter</h3>
            <p>
                This is a program used to count the number of passengers entering the 
                train where javascript implements the counting and saving.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Tab saver browser extension</h3>
            <p>
                This enables one to save all tabs he/she is interested in, in the 
                extension and being able to access them next time they open the browser. 
                They can also delete the tabs anytime. However this may only work on 
                chrome browser of a laptop or PC.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Html form.</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first project (I know it may be a little messy, but it was 
                the first baby step I took towards web development and can be used as a 
                reference to see how far I've come). This is a basic html form which 
                captures data from the user though it isn't fully functional.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Others</h3>
            <p>
                I couldn't possibly put up the flutter app I built since it's meant for
                mobile usage and not web. However those are few of the functionality in 
                pictures. I've also built an AI that can recognize handwritten digits 
                which can also be a very handy feature especially in record keeping.
